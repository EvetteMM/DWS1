	<h1>The Giant Squid</h1>
		<p>The giant squid (genus: <i><strong>Architeuthis</strong></i>) is a deep-ocean dwelling squid in the family <strong>Architeuthidae</strong>, <br />
		represented by as many as eight species. Giant squid can grow to a tremendous size (see <strong>Deep-sea gigantism)</strong>: <br />
		recent estimates put the maximum size at 13 m (43 ft) for females and 10 m (33 ft) for males from the posterior <br />
		fins to the tip of the two long tentacles (second only to the colossal squid at an estimated 14 m (46 ft), one of <br />
		the largest living organisms). The mantle is about 2 m (6.6 ft) long (more for females, less for males), and the <br />
		length of the squid excluding its tentacles is about 5 m (16 ft). Claims of specimens measuring 20 m (66 ft) or <br />
		more have not been scientifically documented.<br /></p>

		<p><h3>First observations in the wild</h3><p>
		<p>On 30 September 2004, researchers from the <acronym title="Museum of Nature and Science">NMNS</acronym> of Tokyo, Japan and <----
		the <acronym title="Ogasawara Whale Watching Association">OWA</acronym> took the first images<br />
		of a live giant squid in its natural habitat. Several of the 556 photographs were released a year later. The NMNS <br />
		and OWA successfully filmed a live adult giant squid for the first time on 4 December 2006.<br /></p>
