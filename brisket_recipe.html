			<p><h4>Instructions</p></h4>
			<ol>
			<li>Rub salt, pepper and paprika into brisket. Heat 2 T oil in large pot.  Add brisket and brown well on both sides. When browned remove brisket from pot.</li>

			<li>Place onions, garlic, celery and carrots in the pot.  Add some of the broth and red wine and use a spatula to loosen the crispy remains of the brisket
from the bottom of the pan.  This will add great flavor and thicken your gravy.  Sautee the vegetables until they begin to soften and remove from pan.</li>

			<li>Place brisket back in the pot and place vegetables on top.  Add tomato sauce and the remaining broth and wine.  Give a quick stir.</li>  

			<li>Bring the pot to a boil and then reduce heat to low.  Let the brisket simmer for about 2 hours until tender.  The last half hour add the potatoes so they do not become too mushy.</li>

			<li>For the final preparation, place the brisket on a cutting board.  Slice thinly against the grain.</li>  

			<li>To serve, place all the brisket in an attractive baking dish and pour the vegetables and a generous amount of the gravy over it.  Serve the remaining gravy in a separate boat or bowl.</li>
			</ol>
			<p><i>This hearty entree goes very well with fluffy egg noodles or creamy mashed potatoes.  Serves: 8</p></i>
